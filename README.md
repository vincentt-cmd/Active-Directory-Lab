# Active Directory Project

## Objective

The objective of this project was to create a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber threats. The primary focus was on integrating Active Directory, Splunk as a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, alongside Kali Linux and Atomic Red Team, to generate realistic attack scenarios and corresponding telemetry. This hands-on experience provided valuable experience  in log analysis, threat detection, and penetration testing.

### Skills Learned

- Proficiency in integrating and managing Active Directory within a controlled lab environment.
- Understanding and practical application of a SIEM (Splunk) for log analysis and threat detection in a SIEM system.
- Experience in generating and simulating attack scenarios using Kali Linux and Atomic Red Team.
- Ability to analyze security event logs and identify anomalies.
- Strengthened problem-solving and critical thinking abilities in detecting and mitigating cybersecurity threats.

### Tools Used

- **Splunk** as a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion, analysis, and threat detection.
- **Active Directory** for setting up and managing user accounts, permissions, and network resources.
- **Kali Linux** for conducting penetration testing and simulating attack scenarios.
- **Atomic Red Team** for generating real-world attack techniques and simulating adversary tactics.
- **Sysmon** for monitoring system activity, logging process creation, network connections, and file modifications
