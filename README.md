# Active Directory Project

## Objective

The goal of this project was to create a controlled environment for simulating real-world cybersecurity scenarios. The focus was on integrating Active Directory, Splunk, Kali Linux, and Atomic Red Team to analyze logs, detect threats, and perform penetration testing. This hands-on experience was aimed at developing practical skills in identifying, analalyzing, and facilitating cybersecurity threats in a simulated environment.
