# Active Directory Project

## Objective

The objective of this project was to create a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber threats. The primary focus was on integrating Active Directory, Splunk as a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, alongside Kali Linux and Atomic Red Team, to generate realistic attack scenarios and corresponding telemetry. This hands-on experience provided valuable experience  in log analysis, threat detection, and penetration testing.

### Skills Learned

- Proficiency in integrating and managing Active Directory within a controlled lab environment.
- Understanding and practical application of a SIEM (Splunk) for log analysis and threat detection in a SIEM system.
- Experience in generating and simulating attack scenarios using Kali Linux and Atomic Red Team.
- Ability to analyze security event logs and identify anomalies.
- Strengthened problem-solving and critical thinking abilities in detecting and mitigating cybersecurity threats.

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
